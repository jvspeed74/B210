Descriptive statistics are a type of quantitative value that describes or summarizes features from a set or group of
data. There are many common forms of descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and range. The mean refers to the
average of all values in the group. The median is the middle value of the group after it has been numerically sorted.
Range is the difference between the highest value in the set and the lowest value in the set. Write a program that asks
the user to input a lower bound, an upper bound, and a step size for the group. The given group should include at least
3 values. The program should then compute the mean, median, and range of the inputted group. Where possible try to use
built-in Python functions. (40 points)
