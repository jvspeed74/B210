# Assignment 2 - Problem List

## Problem #1

Computer literacy is a standard in most elementary school grades in Indiana. This means that students as young as 5 have to be able to login and access their school’s computer network, including a username and password. To make this simple most schools create both usernames and passwords created from the student’s first name, middle name, last name, and parent’s phone number.

Write a program that will generate a user name and password from the given information. The user name should consist of the first 6 letters of their last name, the first letter of their first name, and the first letter of their middle name. The password should be the first 2 letters of their first name, the first 3 (human) even letters of their middle name (as many as possible), and the last 4 numbers of their parent’s phone number. Be certain to print the student’s user name and password to the terminal.

## Problem #2 

Pig Latin is a language game often played by adolescent children. The language uses English words as input, changes them into a new word, typically by extracting the first letter of the word, putting it at the end and adding the suffix “ay” to it. However, if the first letter is a vowel (a,e,i,o,u) instead, it uses moves everything up till the first consonant (non-vowel) to the end and then adds the “ay” suffix.

Write a program that will take an English word as input, and output that word in Pig Latin. Print the Pig Latin word to the terminal.
