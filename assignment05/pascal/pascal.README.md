Pascal’s Triangle is a simple and surprisingly profound mathematical construct with applications to probability theory,
combinatorics, and algebra. It was popularized by French mathematician, Blaise Pascal, but records of it date back
several centuries to scholars from across the world: India, Persia, China, Germany, and Italy. Write a program that asks
the user to input an integer number of rows, and will print a Pascal’s Triangle with that many rows. You will want to
develop a way of determining both the number of values in the pyramid, as well their values based upon the row number
and the number of other values in the row. (The output should be roughly pyrimidal in shape, points will be deducted for
significant deviations.) (40 points)
