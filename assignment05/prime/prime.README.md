Prime numbers are numbers which can only be evenly divided by 1 and itself, or put another way numbers whose factors
include 1 and itself. Prime numbers are of great interest in many fields of mathematics, including cryptography. Write a
program that asks the user for to input an integer and will print all prime numbers between 2 and the inputted number. (
You may want to consider using nested for loops.) (40 points)
