Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that describes how a set of elements can be arranged or organized. Two common
metrics used in combinatorics are combinations, the number of ways items in a set can be arranged, and permutations the
number of sequential ways a set can be arranged. Write a function that takes a string as input, and will generate a list
of all permutations of the characters used in that string. For example, the input ‘AB’ would return ‘AB’ and ‘BA’. Hint:
consider breaking the word into a prefix and a suffix. (40 points)
