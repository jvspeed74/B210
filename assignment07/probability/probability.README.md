Probability plays a essential role in all games of chance from Poker to Roulette. A less common form of games of chance
are games that rely on dice roll. Craps is a classic casino game in which players bet on the outcome of rolling 2 six
dice (2d6). Write a function that takes a dice configuration, and a numeric value as input. The function should then
calculate the probability of rolling a series of numbers on the dice that matches or exceeds the input value (ie. ‘1d6’,
3, would return 4/6). You can use a stats based or a numeric approach, whichever you are more comfortable with. (40
