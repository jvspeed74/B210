## Usage

The script defines a class `Utils` containing utility/helper functions, and a function `count_types` to calculate
character type counts. The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program.

## Purpose

This Python script contains a solution to question 1. It calculates the count of numeric characters, lowercase
characters, uppercase characters, and symbols in a given string and displays the results to the user.


## Inputs

A string of any size

## Expected Output

The expected output is the count of numeric characters, lowercase characters, uppercase characters, and symbols in 
the input string.

## Types of Execution

- Sequential
- Conditional
- Repeated

## Potential Improvements
    
- Error handling could be improved, such as providing more specific error messages for invalid inputs.
- It could handle edge cases more effectively, like empty strings or strings with only whitespace.
