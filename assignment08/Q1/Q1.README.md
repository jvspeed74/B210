We’ve previously discussed the importance of character frequency in cryptography. Most modern encryption techniques are
well beyond the basic ciphers we’ve been using, rather than simple character replacement algorithms, meaning one
character can correspond to multiple different characters, depending on the context. At which point, the frequency of
the different types of characters can be relevant. Write a void function that takes a string as input, and will
calculate the number of numeric characters, lower case characters, upper case characters, and symbols contained in the
string and displays them to the user. Use string functions to make the display aesthetically pleasing. (40 points)
