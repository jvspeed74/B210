# Acrostic Decoder

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to decode an acrostic poem, revealing a secret message encoded within it. The program
provides a utility function to print headers, a function to decode the acrostic poem, and a main function to execute
test cases.

## Input

The program takes the following inputs:

- `acrostic`: The acrostic poem string.
- `first_line`: The starting position for iterating through lines (optional).
- `char_start_pos`: The starting position for iterating through characters in each line (optional).
- `delimiter`: The character that separates lines in the acrostic poem (optional).

## Expected Output

The expected output of the program is the decoded secret message extracted from the acrostic poem.

## Types of Execution

- Sequential
- Conditional
- Repeated

## Improvements

- Error handling: Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
- Input validation: Validate inputs to ensure they are of the correct type and format.
- Expand test cases: Include more diverse test cases to ensure the program's robustness.
