arguments to state what makes the first line, as well as what position should be used.(40 points)

Elizabeth it is in vain you say\t
“Love not” – thou sayest it in so sweet a way:\t
In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.\t
Zantippe’s talents had enforced so well:
Ah! If that language from thy heart arise,\t

Breath it less gently forth — and veil thine eyes.\t
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried\t
To cure his love – was cured of all beside\t
His folly – pride – and passion – for he died.

“An Acrostic” by Edgar Allen Poe
