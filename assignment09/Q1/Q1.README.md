# Sudoku Subgrid Checker

## Description

This Python script contains a solution to question 1. It checks the legality of Sudoku subgrids by examining each cell
for the following criteria:

1. Must be integers in the range 1-9.
2. No duplicate values within the subgrid.

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to provide a solution for checking the legality of Sudoku subgrids. It aims to verify
whether the values within the subgrid meet the criteria required for a valid Sudoku puzzle.

## Input

The program takes Sudoku subgrids as input. Subgrids can be represented as either a flat list of 9 elements or a 3x3
matrix, where each element represents a cell in the Sudoku grid.

## Expected Output

The expected output of the program is to determine whether the input Sudoku subgrid is legal or illegal. If the subgrid
meets the criteria of a legal Sudoku puzzle, it will display "The grid is legal." Otherwise, it will provide
explanations for any detected illegalities, such as non-integer values, values out of the range 1-9, or duplicate values
within the subgrid.

## Execution Type

- Sequential
- Conditional
- Repeated

## Improvement Suggestions

1. Performance Optimization: Optimize the algorithm for checking subgrid legality to improve efficiency, especially for
   larger Sudoku grids.
2. Test Coverage: Expand the test suite to cover a wider range of Sudoku puzzle scenarios, including edge cases and
   invalid inputs.
3. User Interface: Consider developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program to enhance user experience and
   provide visual feedback on subgrid legality.
