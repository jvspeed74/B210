Cryptography is the study of how data is encrypted and decrypted. One of the most basic types of encryption is a cipher,
where each character is replaced with another character. A common technique in analyzing such a cipher is counting the
number of occurrences contained in the acquired messages. This works as a clue to the cipher, because while the letters
have changed their frequency and the syntax of the encoded language hasn’t. Write a program that takes two inputs: a
passage of at least 200 characters, and a character. The program should then scan the passage for number of occurrences
of the specified character. If the character is not contained in the passage, the program should prompt the user to ask
the user to give another character. If the user uses a passage of insufficient size the program should inform them that
the number of characters contained in their passage and prompt them to enter another passage. (40 points)
