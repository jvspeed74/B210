Many programs are multipurpose, proving the user access to multiple functionalities, that they can choose between. For
example, modern word processors don’t just allow users to write files, but they can open files and edit existing files
as well. White a program that allows the users to choose between 2 modes: LCM and GCF. In LCM, the program should take
two integers as input and compute the least common multiple of those numbers. In GCF, the program should take two
integers and input and compute the greatest common factor between those values. In each of those modes, the program
should confirm that the user input is acceptable, if not the program should continue to prompt the user until the input
is acceptable. After completing the task, the program should ask the user what they want to do, and should only stop
after the user inputs ‘Stop’ as the mode. (It may be helpful to use either psuedocode and/or a flow chart to plan this
program) (40 points)

“GCF”, 16, 4, “Stop”

“GCF”, 5, 18, “Stop”
