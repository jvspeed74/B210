    "In the time before credit cards and electronic banking, stores often had to make change for customers. The modern United States Treasury uses 4 different coins for denominations less than 1 dollar quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies each worth $0.25, $0.10, $0.05, and $0.01 respectively. Additionally, they issue dollars in denominations of $100, $50, $20, $10, $5, and $1. In the following problems, you will be given an amount tendered, and the total cost. Write a program that will determine the amount of change needed and the minimum amount of each of the dollar denominations and coins needed for the transaction.\n",
